# Week 13 LUIT project: EC2 Random Name Generator

# Objective: 
# Several departments share an AWS environment. You need to ensure that the EC2s are properly named and are
# unique so team members can easily tell who the EC2 instances belong to. Use Python to create your unique EC2 
# names, so that the users can then attach to the instances. 

#The Python Script should:

# 1. Allow the user to input how many EC2 instances they want names for and output the same amount of unique names.
# 2. Allow the user to input the name of their department that is used in the unique name.
# 3. Generate random characters and numbers that will be included in the unique name.
